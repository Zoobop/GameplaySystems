  _name: Mark of the Bound Soul
  _shortDescription: A strange mark eminating a feint, feiry and ominous glow that
    stings every once in a while. Cannot be removed.
  _longDescription: Those who arrive in the Deadlands are said to suffer an eternity
    of great torment and despair, as their souls remain bound forever to this plane.
    Death is only temporary. There is no escape. The soul may have no rest as it
    withers away until the end of time...
